The dative case is primarily used to denote the **<u>in</u>direct object of a transitive verb**, i.e. the 'second hand' agent. It is usually translated with the English prepositions `to` or `for`.

<Translation
  latin="tradidit munus fratri"
  translations={['He handed the gift to his friend']}
/>

<Translation latin="laboro patriae" translations={['I work for the country']} />

## Other Uses of the Dative Case

Aside from expressing the indirect object of a transitive verb, the dative case may also be used in the following contexts:

### Dative-Taking Verbs

Another common use of the dative case is in dative-taking verbs, which function in a similar manner to [ablative-taking verbs](/notes/nouns/ablative-case#ablative-taking-verbs). These are verbs that force its object to take the dative case.

<Translation
  latin="nōn parcam operae"
  translations={['I will spare no pains']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="subvenī patriae, opitulāre conlēgae"
  translations={['Come to the aid of your country, help your colleague']}
/>

Many verbs signifying the following take the dative case:

- to _favour_, _help_, _please_ or _trust_ (and their contraries)
- to _persuade_, _command_, _threaten_, _obey_ or _serve_
- to _believe_, _resist_, _envy_ or _pardon_

Some common dative-taking verbs are:

- _crēdo_, trust
- _faveō_, favour
- _placeō_, please
- _suādeō_, advise

Not all verbs that have meanings listed above take the dative case - it is by no means a strict rule. **Some verbs of the same meaning instead take the accusative**, such as _adiuvō_, help, or _iubeō_ order.

### Dative of Possession

The dative case may be used in a manner that essentially acts like a [genitive](/notes/nouns/genitive-case), possessing a noun or pronoun.

<Translation
  latin="erant nōbīs multae gemmae pretiōsae"
  translations={[
    'The many precious gemstones were ours',
    'We had many precious gemstones',
  ]}
/>

### Dative of Disadvantage

Another use of the dative case is to indicate the person or people from whom something is being taken. This is called the dative of disadvantage, and should be translated explicitly using the word `from`, as to strongly establish the loss of something. Possessively translating the noun that has been lost is often less clear.

<Translation
  latin="Rōmānī nōbīs lībertātem auferre cōnantur"
  translations={['The Romans were trying to steal our freedom from us']}
/>
