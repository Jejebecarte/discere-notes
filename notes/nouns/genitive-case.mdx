## Other Uses of the Genitive Case

Aside from expressing possession, the genitive case may also be used in the following contexts:

### Partitive Genitive

The most common alternative use of the genitive is the partitive genitive - **used to describe part of a whole**. Here the word denoting a part is followed by the genitive word to which the part belongs.

<Translation latin="quis nostrum" translations={['Which of us?']} />

<Translation
  latin="māgnam partem eōrum interfēcērunt"
  translations={['They killed a large part of them']}
/>

### Genitive of Description

The genitive case may be used to **specify the material or quality** of a noun, i.e. it _describes_ the noun.

<Translation latin="flūmina lactis" translations={['Rivers of milk']} />

<Translation
  latin="vir summae virtūtis"
  translations={['A man of highest courage']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="fossa trium pedum"
  translations={['A trench of three feet', 'A trench three feet deep']}

The genitive of quality may only be used when **when the quality is modified by an adjective**.
