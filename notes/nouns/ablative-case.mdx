## Other Uses of the Ablative Case

Aside from expressing means or accompaniment, the ablative case may also be used in the following contexts:

### Point in Time

The ablative case may be useed **to indicate that an action has taken place at a specific point in time**. Here, the noun (or pronoun) specifies the particular time it took place.

<Translation latin="cōnstitūtā diē" translations={['On the appointed day']} />
<Translation latin="quotā hōrā?" translations={['At what hour?']} />

### Ablative Absolutes

**A noun or pronoun agreeing with a participle in the ablative case** may be used to define the time or circumstances of an action. This type of construction is called the Ablative Absolute. Note the [sequence of tenses](/notes/verbs/overview#sequence-of-tenses) applies here.

Ablative absolutes containing **past participles** should be translated using `after`, `once`, `since` or `when`.

Ablative absolutes containing **present participles** should be translated using `as` or `while`.

<Translation
  latin="leōne vīsō, fēminae fūgērunt"
  translations={[
    'With the lion having been seen, the women fled',
    'Once they saw the lion, the women fled',
  ]}

  ]}

Ablative absolutes may often be identified by their position in a sentence - often occupying a relative clause or with a comma on either side.

When translating an ablative absolute, it **may often be useful to reiterate the subject**, even though a passive participle would ordinarily exclude it.

### Ablative-Taking Verbs

One uncommon use of the ablative is in ablative-taking verbs, which function in a similar manner to [dative-taking verbs](/notes/nouns/dative-case#dative-taking-verbs). These are verbs that force its object to take the ablative case.

<Translation
  latin="aurō hērōs potitur"
  translations={['The hero takes the gold']}
/>

The five deponent ablative-taking verbs are:

- _ūtor_, use
- _fruor_, enjoy
- _fungor_, perform
- _potior_, take possession of
- _vescor_, feed

Along with the above verbs, **there are two other nouns that may take the ablative case**: _opus_ and _ūsus_ (from ūtor).

While these nouns usually mean 'work' and 'use' respectively, they may also be translated as 'need', where the thing being 'needed' takes the ablative case. In such a situation, **these words are often combined with the copulative _est_**.

<Translation
  latin="nunc vīribus ūsus est"
  translations={['Now there is a need for strength']}
/>
