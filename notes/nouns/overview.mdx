The ending of a noun is decided by 4 factors - its **[case](#cases), number, gender, and [declension](#declensions)**.

## Declensions

Latin nouns are divided into five groups, called **declensions**, which determines the pattern of inflection for each [case](#cases), number and gender.

The declension of a noun is a key piece of information used to ascertain its case, number and gender, especially in situations where a particular noun ending is shared by numerous noun forms. Latin dictionaries typically provide the **nominative and genitive singular** endings (in that order), which can be used in conjunction with the [case endings](#case-table) to discover the declension of a noun.

## Cases

Latin nouns come in **7 cases**, each with unique grammatical functions that change how a noun is translated into fluent English, namely:

- [Nominative](/notes/nouns/nominative-case)
- [Vocative](/notes/nouns/vocative-case)
- [Accusative](/notes/nouns/accusative-case)
- [Genitive](/notes/nouns/genitive-case)
- [Dative](/notes/nouns/dative-case)
- [Ablative](/notes/nouns/ablative-case)
- [Locative](/notes/nouns/locative-case)

Here, the locative case is only shown for completeness. Most sources do not list it due to its [lack of use](/notes/nouns/locative-case#usage) in Classical Latin.
