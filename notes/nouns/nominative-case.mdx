The nominative case is most often used to indicate the subject of a finite verb, i.e. who or what is performing the action.

## Verb Agreement

As the subject of a sentence, a nominative case noun must agree in number and gender with the verb of the sentence:

- Correct agreement: `servi liberati sunt`

- Incorrect agreement: `servi liberata sunt`
  _(Here, the perfect passive participle is feminine singular, as opposed to masculine plural.)_

## Other Uses of the Nominative Case

Aside from expressing the subject of a sentence, the nominative case may also be used in the following contexts:

### Predicative Nominatives

The predicative nominative, also known as the _subject complement_, is **a noun or pronoun that follows a linking verb, and renames the subject of a sentence**.

<Translation
  latin="Caecilius est mercator"
  translations={['Caecilius is a merchant']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="Ludi erunt spectaculum magnum"
  translations={['The games will be a great spectacle']}
/>

<Callout type="warn">

Looking online, the terms _predicative nominative_ and _subject complement_ are often used to describe slightly different concepts - often making a distinction between whether the English translation is a noun or adjective. **These terms can be used interchangeably - they refer to the same grammatical concept**.

### Appositives

The nominative case may also be used in apposition - where a it is placed next to another noun to provide further information or clarification about it.

<Translation
  latin="Caecilius, amicus meus, venit"
  translations={['Caecilius, my friend, is coming']}
/>
