title: 'Pronouns'
order: 3
---

A pronoun **indicates a person or thing without either naming or describing it**. Therefore pronouns may stand for nouns when the person or thing only needs to be pointed out, not named. The uses cases of many pronouns overlap with adjectives.

Pronouns as subjects are not usually used in Latin, as the person of a verb is indicated by its ending. However, [personal](#personal-pronouns) and [reflexive pronouns](#reflexive-pronouns) are often used for emphasis.

## Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are typically **used to refer to the speaker, or the people or things a speaker is referring to**. In Latin, the personal pronouns are:

- _ego_, I
- _nōs_, we
- _tū_, you (singular)
- _vōs_, you (plural)

The pronoun _is, ea, id_ is technically [demonstrative](#demonstrative-pronouns), not personal, and is often used in the place of a third person personal pronoun. As such, Latin lacks a third person personal pronoun.

Occasionally, Roman authors use the 'Royal We', the first person plural, to refer themselves, the first person singular.

## Possessive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns are **used to indicate possession of something**. Common examples include:

- _meus, -a, -um_, my
- _noster, -ra, -rum_, our
- _tuus, -a, -um_, your (singular)
- _vester, -ra, -rum_, your (plural)

## Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns are **used to refer to the subject of a sentence**, but function as an object. These generally show that the object of a verb is identical to the subject.

Reflexive pronouns are indentical in form to [personal pronouns](#personal-pronouns).

## Demonstrative Pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are **used to indicate which entity or entities are being referred to**, distinguishing them from others.

<Translation
  latin="tu autem eadem ages?"
  translations={['Are you going to do the same things?']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="nos oportet opus conficere"
  translations={['We must complete the task']}
/>

The following may be used both as adjectives and pronouns:

- _hīc, haec, hoc_, this
- _ille, illa, illud_, that
- _īdem, eadem, idem_, the same

## Relative Pronouns

A relative pronoun is used to attach a subordinate clause to a word preceding it, known as its **antecedent**. The relative pronoun **agrees with its antecedent in number and gender**, however its **case is determined by its own clause**.

<Translation
  latin="iuvenis cuius librum Sextus legit laetus erat"
  translations={['The young man, whose book Sextus read, was happy']}
/>

<Translation latin="tu, quicumque es" translations={['You, whoever you are']} />

The relative pronoun _qui, quae, quod_ is also often used to introduce [purpose clauses](/notes/constructions/subordinate-subjunctive-constructions#purpose-clauses) when it refers to an object in the main clause.
