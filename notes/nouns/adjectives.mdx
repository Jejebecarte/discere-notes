In Latin there are a range of adjectives types, however we primarily care about three: 1st and 2nd Declension adjectives, and 3rd Declension adjectives, and [indeclinable adjectives](#noun-adjective-agreement).

**1st and 2nd Declension adjectives** have _-us, -a, -um_ forms in the dictionary, **representing the masculine, feminine and neuter nominative singular forms**. The way these adjectives decline is often referred to using the example _bonus, bona, bonum_, good.

**3rd Declension adjectives** are further split into three categories:

- Three Termination, e.g. _ācer, ācris, ācre_, sharp. Represents the nominative singular forms of **each** gender.
- Two Termination, e.g. _fortis, forte_, strong. Represents the **masculine and feminine** nominative singular forms, **followed by the neuter**.
- One Termination, e.g. _ferox, ferocis_, fierce. Represents the nominative singular and genitive singular of **all** genders

## Case Tables

## Noun-Adjective Agreement

In Latin, **adjectives must agree in case, number, and gender** with the noun they describe. However, adjectives are **not** required to match in declension, and therefore agreement may be difficult to identify at first glance.

Latin also possesses a few noticeable differences from English when describing certain situations, for example:

- Latin uses the agreement of the **adjective _medius, media, medium_, and another noun to indicate that one thing is in the middle of another**, instead of using the genitive case.
- Indeclinable adjectives, as their names suggests, **do not decline their endings in any way**. A few common examples include:
  - _damnās_, condemned
  - _frūgī_, frugal
  - _nēquam_, worthless
  - _potis_, able
  - _necesse_, necessary
  - _tot, quot, aliquot, totidem_

## Numeral Adjectives

Numeral adjectives come in three forms:

- **Cardinal numbers**, answering the question "How many?"
  - _ūnus_, one
  - _duo_, two, etc
- **Ordinal numbers**, usually derived from the cardinals, answering the question "In which order?"
  - _prīmus_, first
  - _secundus_, second, etc
- **Distributive numerals**, answering the question "How many at a time?"
  - _singulī_, one at a time
  - _bīnī_, two by two, etc

## Superlative and Comparative Degrees

Aside from the usual _positive_ degree, there also exist two other adjective degrees in Latin: _comparative_ and _superlative_.

**The comparative degree** is used to express a greater degree of the quality or quantity the adjective describes. In English, this means adding an _-er_ suffix, e.g. _happier, taller, braver_, or preceeding the word with `more`, e.g. _more happy_, etc. The comparative degree is **usually formed by adding the _-ior_ ending for the masculine and feminine forms, and _-ius_ for the neuter form**.

**The superlative degree** is used to express that something is of the **greatest degree**. In English, there are a number of ways to translate this, including adding an _-est_ suffix, e.g. _happiest, tallest, bravest_, or preceeding the adjective with `most` or `very`. The superlative degree is **usually formed by adding the _-issimus_ ending for the masculine form, _-issima_ for the feminine, and _-issimum_ for the neuter.**

Some adjectives, usually with stems ending in _-ri_, instead form the superlative degree by doubling a letter in its stem. For example the nominative masculine singular superlative form of _ācer_ is _ācerrimus_.

## Substantive Adjectives

Adjectives can also be used in a _substantive_ manner, effectively acting as nouns, i.e. giving the adjective substance. These can be recognised by a lack of an agreeing noun in a sentence, and are normally used in reference to a previously mentioned noun.

For example, the adjective _nostrī_ is often used substantively in military contexts to refer to "our men", or "our soldiers".
