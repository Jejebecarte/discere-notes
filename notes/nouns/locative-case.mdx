The locative case is used to denote the location or 'place where' something happens or exists. It is usually translated with the English words `in`, `at`, `on`, or `upon`.

<Translation
  latin="Romae meae est familia"
  translations={['My family is in Rome']}
/>

<Translation latin="humī dormio" translations={['I sleep on the ground']} />

Importantly, the locative case is highly limited in its usage and **is primarily used with the names of cities, towns and small islands**, although may also be found with a few select other nouns, such as:

- _domus_ (house) - _domī_
- _humus_ (ground) - _humī_
- _rus_ (countryside) - _ruri_ or _rure_

## Usage

As previously mentioned the locative case, while still holding a functioning singular form in Old Latin, (the plural was already identical to the dative and ablative), has indistuingishable endings to a number of other cases in Classical Latin.

The first declension locative is by far the most common, as many Roman places were first declension nouns, such as _Roma_, Rome, or _Trōia_, Troy.

The plural form only exists because some place-names, such as _Athenae_, Athens, only appear in the plural form. The locative plural **is not** used to express being in multiple locations.
