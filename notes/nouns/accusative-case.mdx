The accusative case is primarily used to denote the **direct object of a transitive verb**, i.e. the agent receiving the action.

## The Accusative Case in the Passive Voice

Note that while the accusative case is most often used to mark the object of a sentence, it may be **used to express the agent after the preposition `a(b)`**.

<Translation
  latin="carmina canuntur a poeta"
  translations={['The poems are sung by the poet']}
/>

## Other Uses of the Accusative Case

Aside from expressing the direct object or agent when used with a passive verb, the accusative case may also be used in the following contexts:

### Motion Towards

Often in sentences that express movement or motion towards someone or something, the **destination is often placed in the accusative case**.

<Translation latin="eo ad urbem" translations={['I go to the city']} />

### Duration of Time

The accusative case may also be **used to indicate that an action has taken place over a duration of time**. Here, the noun (or pronoun) specifies the length of time.

<Translation
  latin="per tres horas studui"
  translations={['I studied for three hours']}
/>

The **accusative duration of time** is not to be confused with the **[ablative point in time](/notes/nouns/ablative-case#point-in-time)**.
