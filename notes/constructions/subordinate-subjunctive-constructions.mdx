Usually, the subjunctive mood is found in subordinate, or dependent clauses - a range of which are listed below. However, there are a number of [independent uses of the subjunctive](/notes/constructions/independent-subjunctive).

<Callout type="note">

The [sequence of tenses](/notes/verbs/overview#sequence-of-tenses) applies to all of the following constructions.

</Callout>

## Purpose Clauses

One way to express purpose in Latin is through purpose clauses. Most commonly, Latin uses the words _ut_ and _ne_ to denote positive and negative purpose clauses respectively. However, purpose clauses may also by introduced with the relative _qui, quae, quod_ if it refers to an object in the main clause.

<Translation
  latin="ad urbem festino ut ludos videam"
  translations={['I am hurrying to the city to see the games']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="pontem resciderunt ne hostes flumen transirent"
  translations={['They broke down the bridge lest the enemy crossed the river']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="in silvis se abdidit ne quis se videret"
  translations={['He hid in the woods lest anyone should see him']}
/>

## Cum Clauses

Where _cum_ is usually translated as `with`, it may be translated as `when` or `while` in a cum clause, a type of temporal clause. Latin uses this to express the circumstances that accompanies or preceeded an action takes place, and **may** put the verb in the temporal clause in the subjunctive.

<Callout type="warn">

Cum clauses that use the subjunctive mood **only use the imperfect and pluperfect tense**. The indicative is used to describe the date(s) or time the action occurred.

</Callout>

<Translation
  latin="Hannibal, cum ad montes advenisset, copias allocutus est"
  translations={[
    'When Hannibal arrived at the mountains, he addressed his troops',
  ]}
/>

<Translation
  latin="cum id nūntiātum esset, mātūrat"
  translations={['When this had been reported, he made haste']}
/>

## Result Clauses

Latin expresses that one thing is as a result of another using result clauses, where the verb inside the construction is in the subjunctive mood. These are usually translated into English using `so ... that` or `so that ... not`.

<Translation
  latin="tot sententiae erant ut nemo consentiret"
  translations={['There were so many opinions that no one could agree']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="tanta erat tempestas ut nautae navem non solverent"
  translations={['The storm was so great the the sailors could not set sail']}
/>

Common Latin words used to introduce a result clause include:

- _adeo_, to such an extent
- _ita_, thus, so
- _talis_, of such a kind
- _tam_, so
- _tantus_, so great
- _tot_, so many

## Indirect Commands

Whereas _"Come here"_ is a **direct command**, _"I asked you to come here"_ is an **indirect command**. Latin expresses this using _ut_ or _nē_ for positive and negative constructions respectively, and placing the **verb in the indirect command in the subjunctive**.

<Translation
  latin="deos precor ut novis parcant"
  translations={['I beg the gods to spare us']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="tibi imperavi ne venires"
  translations={['I forbade you to come']}
/>

<Callout type="note">

The words _iubeo_, to order, and _veto_, to tell... not, often do not use _ut_ or _nē_ to introduce an indirect command.

Indirect commands use the present subjunctive when the main verb is present or future tense, and the imperfect subjunctive when the main verb is in the past tense.

</Callout>

Common verbs used to introduce indirect commands include:

- _hortor_, encourage
- _moneō_, warn
- _ōrō_, beg
- _persuādeō_, persaude
- _rogō_, ask

## Indirect Questions

Whereas _"Where did he come from?"_ is a **direct question**, _"I asked where he had come from"_ is an **indirect question**. To express this, Latin uses the same interrogative words, e.g. _quis_, who, or _quid_, what, and puts the **verb in the indirect question in the subjunctive**.

<Translation
  latin="quid ipse sentiam expōnam"
  translations={['I will explain what I think']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="nescio num venturi sint"
  translations={["I don't know if they will come"]}
/>

Although the following example is _exclamatory_, it is not distuingished from the previous _interrogative_ examples, and thus is considered an indirect question.

<Translation
  latin="quam sīs audāx omnēs intellegere potuērunt"
  translations={['All could understand how bold you are']}
/>

## Fear Clauses

In Latin, verbs of fearing are usually followed by _nē_, _nē non_, or _ut_, and a suboordinate clause with a verb in the subjunctive.

<Callout type="warn">

When translating fear clauses, _nē_ is used to express a positive construction, (i.e. "I am afriad he will come"), while _nē non_ and _ut_ express the negative (i.e. "I am afriad he will **not** come").

</Callout>

<Translation
  latin="veritus sum nē venisset"
  translations={['I was afraid that he had come']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="paves nē ducas tu illam"
  translations={['You are afraid to marry her']}
/>

Some common verbs of fearing include: _timeō_, _metuō_, _paveō_, and _vereor_.
