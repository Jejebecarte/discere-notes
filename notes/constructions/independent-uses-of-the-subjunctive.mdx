While the subjunctive mood is most commonly used in [subordinate subjunctive constructions](/notes/constructions/subordinate-subjunctive-constructions), there are also a number of uses of the subjunctive in indepdenent clauses, listed below. Note that often independent subjunctive clauses can fit numerous of the below types. The true intent of the word is best worked out using context clues.

## Jussive and Hortatory Subjunctive

The Jussive, from _iubeō, -ēre, iussī, iussus_, and Hortatory, from _hortor, -ārī, -ātus sum_, are **used to express a command or an exhortation**. The Jussive occurs in the second and third person, while the Hortatory occurs in the first. These constructions are usually translated with `let ...`, `must` or `should`.

3rd Person Jussive:

<Translation
  latin="puerum scelestum pūniant"
  translations={['Let them punish the bad boy']}
/>

1st Person Hortatory:

<Translation
  latin="puerum scelestum pūniāmus"
  translations={['We must punish the bad boy']}
/>

The negative of each type is introduced with _nē_:

<Translation
  latin="nē puerum scelestum pūniāmus"
  translations={['We must not punish the bad boy']}
/>

## Potential Subjunctive

The potential subjunctive is **used to express an action which might possibly occur**. These are best translated into English with `may`, `might` or `could`, similary to the [future tense](/notes/verbs/future-indicative), but less certain.

The **present** subjunctive is used to indicate the action may occur in the future:

<Translation
  latin="puerum scelestum pūniās"
  translations={['You could punish the bad boy']}
/>

The **imperfect** subjunctive is used to indicate the action may have occurred in the past:

<Translation
  latin="puerum scelestum pūnīret"
  translations={['You might have punished the bad boy']}
/>

## Deliberative Subjunctive

The deliberative subjunctive is **used to deliberate about something**, often in a rhetorical question. The negative is introduced with _nōn_.

The **present** subjunctive conveys that it is happening now:

<Translation
  latin="quid dē puerō scelestō faciam?"
  translations={['What should I do about the bad boy?']}
/>

The **imperfect** subjunctive conveys that it happened in the past:

<Translation
  latin="quid dē puerō scelestō facerem?"
  translations={['What should I have done about the bad boy?']}
/>

## Optative Subjunctive

The optative subjunctive, from _optō, -āre_ is **used to express a wish**. Although rare, it is relative easy to spot as it is always introduced by _utinam_, if only, or its negative, _utinam nē_.

The **present** subjunctive expresses a future wish capable of being fulfilled:

<Translation
  latin="utinam puerum scelestum pūniat!"
  translations={['If only he would punish the bad boy!']}
/>

The **imperfect** subjunctive expresses a wish that is **not** capable of being fulfilled in **past** time:

<Translation
  latin="utinam puerum scelestum pūnīret!"
  translations={['If only he was punishing the bad boy!']}
/>

The **pluperfect** subjunctive expresses a wish that is **not** capable of being fulfilled in **past** time:

<Translation
  latin="utinam puerum scelestum pūnisset!"
  translations={['If only he had punished the bad boy!']}
/>
