Conditional clauses are used to express the possible outcomes of a situation or event. Conditional clauses are usually introdcued by _sī_, if, its negative, _nisi_, or an equivalent.

## Real Conditional Clauses

Real conditionals state what **will** happen if a condition is met. Thus, **real conditionals use the indicative mood**, however they may vary in tense to convey when the condition is fulfilled.

Present real:

<Translation
  latin="sī pugnat, vincit"
  translations={['If he fights, he wins']}
/>

Past real with the perfect or imperfect tense:

<Translation
  latin="sī pugnāvit, vīcit"
  translations={['If he fought, he won']}
/>

<Translation
  latin="sī pugnābat, vincēbat"
  translations={['If he was fighting, he was winning']}
/>

Future real:

<Translation
  latin="sī pugnāverit, vincet"
  translations={['If he fights, he will win']}
/>

## Hypothetical Conditional Clauses

Hypothetical conditionals state what **would** happen if a condition, and thus **use the subjunctive mood** to convey this sense of uncertainty.

Present hypothetical with the imperfect tense:

<Translation
  latin="sī pugnaret, vinceret"
  translations={['If he were fighting, he would be winning']}
/>

Past hypothetical with the pluperfect tense:

<Translation
  latin="sī pugnāvisset, vīcisset"
  translations={['If he had fought, he would have won']}
/>

Future hypothetical with the present tense:

<Translation
  latin="sī pugnet, vincat"
  translations={['If he were to fight, he would win']}
/>

A handy way to check your translation of a mixed hypothetical is if you can add the phrase "... but he didn't" to the end and it makes sense. This helps to enforce the sense of uncertainty this type of conditional clause is designed to convey.

## Mixed Conditional Clauses

The most common type of conditional clauses are mixed conditionals. These are conditional clauses that **combine different tenses** in the 'if' clause and the main clause to convey more specific timings for each part of the construction. The translation of each part should be adjusted to fit its tense and mood.

Mixed conditional clauses are only mixed in tense, not mood. (i.e. you cannot get a mixed hypothetical and real conditional clause.)

The following is a mixed hypothetical using the pluperfect and imperfect tense:

<Translation
  latin="sī pugnāvisset, vīnceret"
  translations={['If he had fought, he would be winning [now]']}
